## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been researching and trying to implement the Biometrics API. I found that there are problems with this API, especially in backwards compatibility with android devices that are not running at least Android version P. I am now working on continuing the Biometrics while making version and hardware checks. My teammate will be working on using the FingerprintManager API for use when the device does not meet the requirements for the Biometrics API.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- Work on continuing research and adding functions to check hardware and android version before creating a prompt for biometrics.

## Anything Blocking?
