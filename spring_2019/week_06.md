## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- This week was spent cleaning up code and solving some smaller bugs. I needed to clean up some redundant code, as there were some extra files, classes and functions that were clogging up the workspace. I organized all of the biometric checks into easy to use functions, and I deleted extra xml files that were not being used. This makes the work going forward much easier.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- Now that all the code is cleaned up and the workspace is much more manageable, I can begin working on the biometric prompt and making that work with all of the requirements for a biometric prompt.

## Anything Blocking?

- No Blockers
