## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been working more on the Biometric implementation for the app. I have finished creating the precautionary steps before the app can begin asking for fingerprints. This includes a check on the users hardware, software, if they have the appropriate level of security on their phone (password, pin, etc.) and if they have a fingerprint that is able to be checked. If any one of these conditions are not met, the biometric prompt should not come up.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- I will work on implementing the actual biometric prompt that will show up that the user can actually interact with in order to get to the Map screen.

## Anything Blocking?
