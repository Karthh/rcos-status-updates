## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been cleaning up old code that was causing some problems and I implemented some of the Biometrics API. We have come to a decision that I would implement the Biometric API for fingerprints for Android devices running at least Android P, while Matilda would be doing FingerprintManager for devices below Android P. I got rid of some old repetitive code that was causing the App to install with the wrong icon.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
