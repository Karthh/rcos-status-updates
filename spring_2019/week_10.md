## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have worked on improving the Map activity. It now has a location button in the top right corner that moves the camera to my current location, and I have added a pin on the screen to represent a door, and upon clicking that pin I have created an infowindow that pops up. When that infowindow is clicked, the activity switches to an unlock activity, that displays the current state of the door, locked or unlocked. Unfortunately, I cannot go much further than this because in order to unlock the door, I need to send a bluetooth signal, which an emulator cannot do. I can't make much more progress on the app without a physical phone.

## This Week's Plan
