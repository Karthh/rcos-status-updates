## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been learning how to use the Biometric API to generate a biometric prompt that the user can interact with in order to act as a method of logging into the app. I have been able to make a biometric prompt come up after some testing in kotlin, that can take in a fingerprint or will gracefully cancel if the user hits the cancel button instead of providing a fingerprint. This allows the app to take in fingerprint data, and if the fingerprint data matches what is needed, the app can perform specific actions. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- Work on desigining app behavior for when a fingerprint matches one registered on the devices, and design behavior for when the fingerprint does not match. I will need to create a Map activity for the app to go to when the fingerprint matches, and I'll need to produce an error when the fingerprint does not match.

## Anything Blocking?

- No Blockers
