## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have began to work on the Map Activity, and working with the google maps API to create the map screen on the IOS version of the app. I have obtained a google map API key and I have created a very basic activity that uses this google map key to create a map screen. This map screen runs off of google maps and it displays my current location and can move around.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- Now that all the groundwork in creating a Map activity is done, I can work on making it specific to the app. I will add a button to move the map camera to my current location, and add a pin to represent a door.
