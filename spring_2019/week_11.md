## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been ironing out bugs and getting rid of some code that would not make the demo for the presentation look bad. Additionally, my changes were merged with Matilda's to add a seperate way of logging in with fingerprints for older devices and a setting window. A video was made to use in the demo for the presentation, and the presentation was given. Hopefully over the next semester we can acquire an android device and the bluetooth signal can be completed and the android version of the app will be fully functional.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- The semester is over, but for the next semester an android device will need to be obtained, and the bluetooth command will need to be implemented to interact with the automatic door opener. In addition, pins can be fetched from a JSON file so that instead of an example pin, some real pins reperesenting real doors can be added with data from the JSON file that is maintained by someone else. This would make the android app almost completely functional and usable. 

## Anything Blocking?

- Need an android device.

## Notes

- Nothing of note
