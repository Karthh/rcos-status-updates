## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have finished the entirety of the Biometric functionality for the app. At this point it will now generate a biometric prompt if the app detects that the phone has the proper security levels, fingerprints registered, hardwared and software in order to do so. When the biometric prompt comes up, the app will either move to the Map activity where Google maps will be used to create a map where the doors will be able to be interacted with. On fingerprint fail, the biometric prompt will produce an animation and will reprompt the user for a fingerprint.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- Work on implementing google maps and make the now blank map activity an actual activity with a interactive map. This will then be used with a pin on the map to represent the door.
