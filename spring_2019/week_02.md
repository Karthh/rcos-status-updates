## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Over the past week I have been working on finding the viability of a fingerprint id and a facial recognition feature. I determined that a facial recognition login would not be viable for android devices and that I should focus on creating fingerprint id login, using 
the Biometrics API. I have started researching this other API.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

- I will be working on researching the Biometrics API and will be working on implementing that into the login screen.
